                    <p>My name is Andrei and I am a Chef since 2013. <br>
                        Before attending specialized courses, which are presented in the specific sections of this Curriculum, I practiced football for 15 years. <br>
                        Then I had various jobs such as: construction site worker, street paving and asphalting worker, worker distributing advertising leaflets. <br>
                        I did these activities during the college I attended, but unfortunately I didn't finish. <br>
                        After these activities, I pursued those specific to gastronomy, which, as I mentioned above, I will describe and detail in the other sections.<br>
                        From 2021 I started learning programming languages such as C++, SQL, but also HTML and CSS. As a result, this website where I wrote this Curriculum is made by me.</p>
